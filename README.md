# cells-in-gel
This is the repo of team Cells-in-gels. Most of us work in the DeForest group, studying how biomaterials can influence cell behavior. As such, this project analyzes how functionalizing poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels with the adhesion motif RGD in different concentrations affects cell spreading and proliferation. We will design a pipeline for processing fluorescent images taken on a Leica confocal.
